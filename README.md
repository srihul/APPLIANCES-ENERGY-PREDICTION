# Appliances Energy Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the energy consumption of home appliances using historical usage data. This project provides a user-friendly GUI for uploading CSV datasets and predicting energy usage using a linear regression model.

## 🔍 Project Overview

With growing attention to energy efficiency, this project aims to build a simple yet effective tool to forecast home appliance energy consumption. It is built using Python with a GUI for ease of use, making it accessible to non-technical users.
